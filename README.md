# Rating Requests for Help

A cohort of programming students—Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, Tahani and Michael—each need help with their code, and they are each using different approaches to ask their mentor, Janet, for help. After you read the descriptions of the situations each are in, identify whether or not their requests are Good or Bad.

* Eleanor wrote some Ruby code to evaluate statistical input and calculate the likelihood of her favorite wrestler winning his next six matches. Unfortunately, it's only returning errors. Because she wasn't sure where the problem was, she sent the entire codebase to Janet.

  * Good request
  * Bad request X (too much code in sample)

* Chidi made a Rails app to organize his library of books, but was having trouble creating new Book objects. He read through the Ruby documentation and discovered the method he needed.

  * Good request X (consulted documentation)
  * Bad request

* Tahani decided to use the Instagram API to display a photofeed on her website. She looked at other coders who had done the same thing and tried to transfer their code to her own site, but couldn't get it to work properly. She turned to Janet to determine why she didn't get the same result as the others did.

  * Good request
  * Bad request X (did not understand the theory of the result she was expecting)

* Jason made an app to track the records of his favorite football players. The first step he took after setting up the app framework was to start coding the various methods he wanted.

  * Good request
  * Bad request X (did not test implementation)

* Michael made an app to rate different neighborhoods in his city according to their walkability, school district quality and number of frozen yogurt shops. His app wasn't returning sensible results, so he focused in a small bit of code at a time, verified his inputs/outputs, described and theorized his expectations, double-checked his documentation and tested out his code. When none of that gave him the correct result, he asked Janet for help.

  * Good request X (submitted question after completing all the process steps)
  * Bad request
